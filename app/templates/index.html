      <h3>-Personal Brand Statement-</h3>
      <h4>Key Career or Business Attributes:</h4>
      <img class="mountain1" src="../static/images/El Capitan.jpg" alt="mountain1">
      <p>I am a Professional Licensed Land Surveyor with cross disciplinary experience in Civil Engineering, Architecture, Environmental Science and Real Estate Law. My most valuable skill is the ability to represent data in graphical forms, predominately as maps, which were then subjected to QA/QC from clients and other professionals.</p>
      <p>I have data processing experience analyzing information collected by robotic instruments and GPS and performing accuracy calculations using the Least Squares adjustment. My project experience includes local, state, and federal projects as well as private residential and commercial development.</p>

      <h3>Why Python Programming?</h3>
      <h4>A synopsis of my career change.</h4>
      <img class="mountain2" src="../static/images/El Capitan 2.jpg" alt="mountain2">
      <p>Iâ€™m proud of my achievements in the land surveying profession, but after twenty years in the industry, I found myself losing interest and motivation in my work. These effects lead me to search for other career paths I could relate my spatial analysis skills too.</p>
      <p>Python is used in a variety of mapping software, the idea of using it as a tool to further my skill set for spatial analysis seemed a viable option for a career path. I hope to be able to build off of my cartography and research skills, by adding a technology aspect, which I can use to find a fulfilling employment opportunity.</p>
